## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install [DFINITY SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/local-setup)
- Install Node.js and npm

### Steps to Run Locally
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rentique.git
cd rentique-icp

# Install frontend dependencies
cd src/rentique-icp-frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ../../

# Start the local replica
dfx start --background

# Deploy backend and frontend canisters
dfx canister create --all
dfx build
dfx deploy
```

## Deployment
For deployment on the Internet Computer, ensure you have an ICP wallet set up. Run:
```sh
dfx deploy --network ic
```

## Usage
Once deployed, access the frontend via:
```
[http://bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai.localhost:4943/](https://fyye2-laaaa-aaaah-qqacq-cai.icp0.io/
)
```
And the backend API via:
```
 https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=f7zco-gyaaa-aaaah-qqaca-cai
```

To learn more before you start working with `rentique`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd rentique/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
